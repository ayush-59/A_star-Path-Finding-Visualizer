# A_star-Path-Finding-Visualizer
Path Finding visualizer using A* search Algorithm using pygame.
It is a visualizing tool that shows how the A* algorithm finds the path.

How To Use -

LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON: Set start, goal and the walls. 
If start is not set                  - it will set Start.
If Start is set and Goal is not set  - It will set the Goal.
If both Start and Goal set           - It will create walls.

RIGHT_MOUSE_BUTTON: Remove start, goal, walls.

SPACEBAR: Runs the algorithm and finds path from Start to Goal.
